# Specification Quality Checklist: Phase V Todo Chatbot

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-09
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

| Category | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Content Quality | PASS | Spec focuses on WHAT, not HOW |
| Requirements | PASS | 28 functional requirements, all testable |
| User Stories | PASS | 7 prioritized stories with acceptance scenarios |
| Success Criteria | PASS | 18 measurable outcomes defined |
| Edge Cases | PASS | 6 edge cases documented |
| Assumptions | PASS | 8 assumptions documented |
| Out of Scope | PASS | Clear boundaries defined |

## Notes

- Specification is complete and ready for `/sp.plan`
- No clarifications needed - reasonable defaults applied for all ambiguous areas
- All assumptions documented in Assumptions section
- Out of Scope section clearly defines boundaries
